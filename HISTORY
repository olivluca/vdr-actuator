VDR Plugin 'actuator' Revision History
--------------------------------------
XXXX-XX-XX: Version 1.0.5
- Updated russian translation from Vladimir Monchenko <bob at globall ru>
- Compatibility defines in module.c and remove patches

2007-06-24: Version 1.0.4
- check the CardIndex to identify the selected card in the main menu instead
  of relying on cDevice::GetDevice(index)
- added a note in README to clarify that if you select card 1 it corresponds
  to /dev/dvb/adapter0, 2 to /dev/dvb/adapter1 and so on
- adapted for the experimental version of vdr (1.5.X)

2006-04-31: Version 1.0.3
- use k_Repeat for up,down,left and right
- update Makefile for compatibility with vdr >= 1.3.47
- using the cRemote::CallPlugin kludge coupled with MainThreadHook there's no
  need to patch vdr for position display
- setup option to select wether to display the position on satellite change
  or not
- remove the transponders directory from the distribution

2006-01-18: Version 1.0.2
- russian translation with correct encoding 
  (by Monchenko Vladimir <bob at globall ru>)
- patch for kernel >= 2.6.13 (provided by Monchenko Vladimir 
  <bob at globall ru> and Frank Welter <frank.welter at skynet dot be>
- patches adapted to vdr-1.3.38/1.3.39

2005-10-30: Version 1.0.1
- Simplified cPosTracker (start the thread only when needed so get rid of
  the cCondWait)
- Avoid tracking if the target hasn't changed after switching channels
- Added svdrp support for querying the positioner status
- return osContinue to avoid auto closing by main vdr loop
- use MAXLANGCODE2

2005-08-07: Version 1.0.0
- It's been working for a year, let's call it 1.0.0 ;-) 
- Save channels after a transponder/satellite scan
- New menu entries to mark, unmark and delete marked channels ("mark" means
  prepending '+' to the name to aid finding stale channel entries)
- After a satellite scan the transponder index was reset at 1 but the
  pointer was NULL. Fixed to point at the first transponder.
- Added a note in module/README about possible problems with irq7 (as
  reported by Frank Welter) 
- fixed test.py (in the module subdirectory) to work with python 2.4
- wrap-around menu
- themes support
- use setup settings for osd position and width

2005-03-31: Version 0.0.9
- Dutch translation by Johan Schuring <vetteblei at gmail dot com>
- Fast transponder/satellite scan, thanks to the wonderful work of Thomas
  Bergwinkl <bergwinkl.thomas at vr-web dot de> who provided filter.[ch] to make it
  possible

2005-02-13: Version 0.0.8
- Implement new (in vdr-1.3.20) method Stop
- Removed the note about the dxr3 shutdown problem (saving the dish position
  early with the Stop method makes the problem irrelevant)
- Skip non satellite sources in main menu
- Changed pid assignment in cMainMenuActuator::Tune() to (hopefully) avoid
  problems with  the new audio pid management in vdr
- Added "Scan satellite" option (idea shamelessly stolen from
  kikko77 at altervista dot org, author of the channelscan plugin) 
- Changed the 'position-display' patch (adapted for vdr-1.3.20 and
  avoids overwriting the osd of the newly entered channel number if the
   dish is moving) 
- New parameter MinRefresh, to avoid screen artifacts with a dxr3
 
2005-02-06: Version 0.0.7
- Added the possibility to specify vpid and apid when tuning to a
  transponder.
- Added some logic to show the tuned channel (I'm not sure it is right
  but "it works here"(tm))
- Added the "steerable" and "sort-by-source" patch
- Show signal information like the femon plugin (i.e. show signal
  strength and snr as raw value and percentage, show ber and unc)
- Added catalan translation

2005-01-09: Version 0.0.6
- New version for vdr 1.3.18
- Note in README that the solution to the dxr3 shutdown problem is only
  a workaround and not the definitive solution

2004-10-18: Version 0.0.5
- Kernel module: added parameter description
- Fixed compilation error for vdr 1.3.13

2004-08-30: Version 0.0.4
- Kernel module: corrected and revised use of lock (now an rwlock) to
  use the irqsave/irqrestore version in non interrupt code (doh!). 
- Kernel module: added sysfs support
- Corrected calculation of signal strength and snr (now it should really
  give the same values as the rotor plugin)
- Removed unneded cMenuEditIntpItem
- Take into accunt which card is connected to the steerable dish (doh!)
- Added a note in README about the problems with vdr in multi card setups
  and the dxr3 plugin
- Cannot use the frontend directly to tune a new transponder, use
  ChannelSwitch instead.

2004-08-20: Version 0.0.3
- I reversed the parameter meaning between DrawRectangle and DrawText that
  lead to some error messages not being shown. Fixed.
- Loading of the position at startup where it belongs: in cPosTracker
- workaround for Setup.UpdateChannels moved to cPosTracker

2004-08-14: Version 0.0.2

- Kernel module: setting the position and immediatiely setting a target with
  the same position would result in the module sticking in the ACM_REACHED
  state. Hopefully fixed.
- Kernel module: now setting a new target clears the ACM_REACHED state.
- Set the current position at initialization only if the module has just been
  loaded (position 0), otherwise trust the position stored in the driver.
- Moved position storing in separate thread
- OSD cleanup
- Modfied patch to not mess up channel switching while the dish is moving

2004-08-11: Version 0.0.1

- Initial revision.
