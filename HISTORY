VDR Plugin 'actuator' Revision History
--------------------------------------
2004-08-30: Version 0.0.4
- Kernel module: corrected and revised use of lock (now an rwlock) to
  use the irqsave/irqrestore version in non interrupt code (doh!). 
- Kernel module: added sysfs support
- Corrected calculation of signal strength and snr (now it should really
  give the same values as the rotor plugin)
- Removed unneded cMenuEditIntpItem
- Take into accunt which card is connected to the steerable dish (doh!)
- Added a note in README about the problems with vdr in multi card setups
  and the dxr3 plugin
- Cannot use the frontend directly to tune a new transponder, use
  ChannelSwitch instead.

2004-08-20: Version 0.0.3
- I reversed the parameter meaning between DrawRectangle and DrawText that
  lead to some error messages not being shown. Fixed.
- Loading of the position at startup where it belongs: in cPosTracker
- workaround for Setup.UpdateChannels moved to cPosTracker

2004-08-14: Version 0.0.2

- Kernel module: setting the position and immediatiely setting a target with
  the same position would result in the module sticking in the ACM_REACHED
  state. Hopefully fixed.
- Kernel module: now setting a new target clears the ACM_REACHED state.
- Set the current position at initialization only if the module has just been
  loaded (position 0), otherwise trust the position stored in the driver.
- Moved position storing in separate thread
- OSD cleanup
- Modfied patch to not mess up channel switching while the dish is moving

2004-08-11: Version 0.0.1

- Initial revision.
