VDR Plugin 'actuator' Revision History
-----------------------------------

2004-08-14: Version 0.0.2

- Kernel module: setting the position and immediatiely setting a target with
  the same position would result in the module sticking in the ACM_REACHED
  state. Hopefully fixed.
- Kernel module: now setting a new target clears the ACM_REACHED state.
- Set the current position at initialization only if the module has just been
  loaded (position 0), otherwise trust the position stored in the driver.
- Moved position storing in separate thread
- OSD cleanup
- Modfied patch to not mess up channel switching while the dish is moving

2004-08-11: Version 0.0.1

- Initial revision.
