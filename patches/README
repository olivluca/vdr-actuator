Use the highest version of the patch (xxx) according to your vdr version

vdr-xxx-position-display.diff
  Apply this patch if you want an OSD indication of the dish position while
  it is moving (see the main README file)

vdr-xxx-steerable.diff
  Apply this patch to avoid waiting for a lock after switching channel since
  it doesn't work well if the new channel is on a different satellite (see
  the main README file).

vdr-xxx-sort-by-source.diff
  Apply this patch if you want:
  1) to always see the satellite position in the channels list (so you know
     in advance if the dish is going to move)
  2) to sort channels by source (i.e. pressing 0 will switch between
     number->name->provider->source+number->source+name->source+provider,
     an asterisk in each entry will show that the list is sorted by source)
     README

vdr-xxx-Source-dependant-NewChannels-Insertation.diff
  Apply this patch if you want new channels added depending on the satellite
  (if a section "New channels @ xx" already exists, new channels will be put
  there, otherwise a section with the current position will be created).
